 <h3>Why Telegram Auth</h3>

 <p>
	 There are a plethora of IM services these days and everyone seems to use a different one. This
	 presents a challenge for designing a service involving auto-created group chats. We ultimately
	 decided on Telegram for a number of reasons.

		 <li>Free forever</li>
		 <li>Transparent mission with no profit pressure</li>

	 </ol>

 <p>
	 Despite these positive properties, Telegram is definitely not the most common IM app (at least in our group
	 of friends). This means that people interested in this service will need to create a Telegram account and
	 download the App before they can get involved. The signup flow is very quick and easy so don't let this
	 deter you!
